                                <p>My name is Kelly Rivas. I was born in New York and moved to North Carolina at the age of 9. My family moved to the Lake Norman area in 2006 and have been living here ever since. I moved to Wilmington, North Carolina to continue my education at Cape Fear Community college and will be graduating from their institution in the fall of 2020 with an Associates in Science. I am currently living in Charlotte, North Carolina while attending the Coding Bootcamp at The University Of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am a hardworking and determined individual that aspires to excel as a woman in tech. I come from a native spanish-speaking background and I intend to use that to my fullest advantage. With my knowledge and work ethic I believe that I can contribute a great deal of success to a company and utilize my skills to integrate it with humanpower and build a better community and also create the necessary building blocks for my career. In my free time I like to do photography, longboard, and DIY projects. I can't wait to hear from you! </p>
